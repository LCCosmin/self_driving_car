# Self Driving Car

A car that drives itself from point A (top - left corner) to point B (bottom - right corner) and reverse.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Possibilities

* Click on the screen to draw sand . The car will have to avoid it.
* Clear Button - Use it to erase all the drawed sand.
* Save Button - Use it to save the brain of the car for later usage.
* Load Button - Use it to load the brain of the car, instead of starting from 0.

P.S: I have trained already a brain and saved it to this repository. You can load it straight ahead if you do not want to wait untill the AI learns what to do.

### Prerequisites

[Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/) is required to run the application.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Download the repository
2. Load the map.py and ai.py in an IDE (Pycharm, Spyder etc)
3. Compile the project, having as main map.py

PyCharm : https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

Anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

### Possible Issues

Clicking on the very top of the window to draw sand, might cause a crash . On some systems I've encountered this issues but on others I have not
